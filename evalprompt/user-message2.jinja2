You are an expert in {{languageId}} programming language and OpenAPI.
Generate a complete and valid OpenAPI Specification from the provided {{languageId}} Web API code.
Please generate the content of a file in plain text format. Do not include any Markdown or other formatting. I only need the raw content.
Include the required info object with title, description, version, and contact details.
Ensure every operation (GET, POST, etc.) includes a summary, description, tags, and operationId.

Validate the resulting spec file against OpenAPI 3.0+ standards.
Use YAML format for the output, without any additional information.

If this task cannot be completed, return "Sorry, I can't assist" and provide an explanation.
